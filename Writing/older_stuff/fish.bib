	Abstract = {Commercially important species often are overexploited, and many endangered mammals and birds are threatened by hunting and international trade. To sustain biological resources requires harvesting strategies that maximize yield while accounting for stochastic dynamics, uncertainty, and risk of resource collapse or extinction. For a large class of population dynamics, the optimal strategy is to harvest all individuals above a threshold population size, with no harvest below the threshold. Maximizing the expected cumulative harvest before extinction puts the optimal threshold at carrying capacity, regardless of the form of expected dynamics or the magnitude of stochasticity. Maximizing the mean annual yield lowers the optimal threshold, which then depends on the form of expected dynamics and the magnitude of stochasticity. Uncertainty in estimated population sizes increases the threshold, and with large uncertainty, the optimal strategy is proportional threshold harvesting, involving harvest of only a fract...},

	Abstract = {The management and conservation of the world's oceans require synthesis of spatial data on the distribution and intensity of human activities and the overlap of their impacts on marine ecosystems. We developed an ecosystem-specific, multiscale spatial model to synthesize 17 global data sets of anthropogenic drivers of ecological change for 20 marine ecosystems. Our analysis indicates that no area is unaffected by human influence and that a large fraction (41\%) is strongly affected by multiple drivers. However, large areas of relatively little human impact remain, particularly near the poles. The analytical process and resulting maps provide flexible tools for regional and global efforts to allocate conservation resources; to implement ecosystem-based management; and to inform marine spatial planning, education, and basic research},

	Abstract = {Organisms are expected to adapt or move in response to climate change, but observed distribution shifts span a wide range of directions and rates. Explanations often emphasize biological distinctions among species, but general mechanisms have been elusive. We tested an alternative hypothesis: that differences in climate velocity-the rate and direction that climate shifts across the landscape-can explain observed species shifts. We compiled a database of coastal surveys around North America from 1968 to 2011, sampling 128 million individuals across 360 marine taxa. Climate velocity explained the magnitude and direction of shifts in latitude and depth much more effectively than did species characteristics. Our results demonstrate that marine species shift at different rates and directions because they closely track the complex mosaic of local climate velocities},

@article{Simpsonetal2011,
	Abstract = {Climate change affects marine biological processes from genetic to ecosystem levels [1-3]. Recent warming in the northeast Atlantic [4, 5] has caused distributional shifts in some fish species along latitudinal and depth gradients [6,\udot7], but such changes, as predicted by climate envelope models [8], may often be prevented because population movement requires availability of suitable habitat. We assessed the full impacts of warming on the commercially important European continental shelf fish assemblage using a data-driven Eulerian (grid-based) approach that accommodates spatial heterogeneity in ecological and environmental conditions. We analyzed local associations of species abundance and community diversity with climatic variables, assessing trends in 172 cells from records of >100 million individuals sampled over 1.2 million km(2) from 1980-2008. We demonstrate responses to warming in 72\% of common species, with three times more species increasing in abundance than declining, and find these trends reflected in international commercial landings. Profound reorganization of the relative abundance of species in local communities occurred despite decadal stability in the presence-absence of species. Our analysis highlights the importance of focusing on changes in species abundance in established local communities to assess the full consequences of climate change for commercial fisheries and food security},

	Abstract = {Species distribution models (SDMs) use spatial environmental data to make inferences on species' range limits and habitat suitability. Conceptually, these models aim to determine and map components of a species' ecological niche through space and time, and they have become important tools in pure and applied ecology and evolutionary biology. Most approaches are correlative in that they statistically link spatial data to species distribution records. An alternative strategy is to explicitly incorporate the mechanistic links between the functional traits of organisms and their environments into SDMs. Here, we review how the principles of biophysical ecology can be used to link spatial data to the physiological responses and constraints of organisms. This provides a mechanistic view of the fundamental niche which can then be mapped to the landscape to infer range constraints. We show how physiologically based SDMs can be developed for different organisms in different environmental contexts. Mechanistic SDMs have different strengths and weaknesses to correlative approaches, and there are many exciting and unexplored prospects for integrating the two approaches. As physiological knowledge becomes better integrated into SDMs, we will make more robust predictions of range shifts in novel or non-equilibrium contexts such as invasions, translocations, climate change and evolutionary shifts},

	Abstract = {Good decision making for fisheries and marine ecosystems requires a capacity to anticipate the consequences of management under different scenarios of climate change. The necessary ecological forecasting calls for ecosystem-based models capable of integrating multiple drivers across trophic levels and properly including uncertainty. The methodology presented here assesses the combined impacts of climate and fishing on marine food-web dynamics and provides estimates of the confidence envelope of the forecasts. It is applied to cod (Gadus morhua) in the Baltic Sea, which is vulnerable to climate-related decline in salinity owing to both direct and indirect effects (i.e. through species interactions) on early-life survival. A stochastic food web-model driven by regional climate scenarios is used to produce quantitative forecasts of cod dynamics in the twenty-first century. The forecasts show how exploitation would have to be adjusted in order to achieve sustainable management under different climate scenarios},

@article{Merinoetal2010,
	Abstract = {The world's small pelagic fish populations, their fisheries, fishmeal and fish oil production industries and markets are part of a globalised production and consumption system. The potential for climate variability and change to alter the balance in this system is explored by means of bioeconomic models at two different temporal scales, with the objective of investigating the interactive nature of environmental and human-induced changes on this globalised system. Short-term (interannual) environmental impacts on fishmeal production are considered by including an annual variable production rate on individual small pelagic fish stocks over a 10-year simulation period. These impacts on the resources are perceived by the fishmeal markets, where they are confronted by two aquaculture expansion hypotheses. Long-term (2080) environmental impacts on the same stocks are estimated using long-term primary production predictions as proxies for the species' carrying capacities, rather than using variable production rates, and are confronted on the market side by two alternative fishmeal management scenarios consistent with IPCC-type storylines. The two scenarios, World Markets and Global Commons, are parameterized through classic equilibrium solutions for a global surplus production bioeconomic model, namely maximum sustainable yield and open access, respectively. The fisheries explicitly modelled in this paper represent 70\% of total fishmeal production, thus encapsulating the expected dynamics of the global production and consumption system. Both short and long-term simulations suggest that the sustainability of the small pelagic resources, in the face of climate variability and change, depends more on how society responds to climate impacts than on the magnitude of climate alterations per se.},

@article{Moraetal2007,
	Abstract = {Populations of many species are dramatically declining worldwide, but the causal mechanism remains debated among different human-related threats. Coping with this uncertainty is critical to several issues about the conservation and future of biodiversity, but remains challenging due to difficulties associated with the experimental manipulation and/or isolation of the effects of such threats under field conditions. Using controlled microcosm populations, we quantified the individual and combined effects of environmental warming, overexploitation and habitat fragmentation on population persistence. Individually, each of these threats produced similar and significant population declines, which were accelerated to different degrees depending upon particular interactions. The interaction between habitat fragmentation and harvesting generated an additive decline in population size. However, both of these threats reduced population resistance causing synergistic declines in populations also facing environmental warming. Declines in population size were up to 50 times faster when all threats acted together. These results indicate that species may be facing risks of extinction higher than those anticipated from single threat analyses and suggest that all threats should be mitigated simultaneously, if current biodiversity declines are to be reversed},

	Abstract = {The benefits of protected areas (PAs) for biodiversity have been questioned in the context of climate change because PAs are static, whereas the distributions of species are dynamic. Current PAs may, however, continue to be important if they provide suitable locations for species to colonize at their leading-edge range boundaries, thereby enabling spread into new regions. Here, we present an empirical assessment of the role of PAs as targets for colonization during recent range expansions. Records from intensive surveys revealed that seven bird and butterfly species have colonized PAs 4.2 (median) times more frequently than expected from the availability of PAs in the landscapes colonized. Records of an additional 256 invertebrate species with less-intensive surveys supported these findings and showed that 98\% of species are disproportionately associated with PAs in newly colonized parts of their ranges. Although colonizing species favor PAs in general, species vary greatly in their reliance on PAs, reflecting differences in the dependence of individual species on particular habitats and other conditions that are available only in PAs. These findings highlight the importance of current PAs for facilitating range expansions and show that a small subset of the landscape receives a high proportion of colonizations by range-expanding species},

@article{DoakMorris2010,
	Abstract = {To persist, species are expected to shift their geographical ranges polewards or to higher elevations as the Earth's climate warms. However, although many species' ranges have shifted in historical times, many others have not, or have shifted only at the high-latitude or high-elevation limits, leading to range expansions rather than contractions. Given these idiosyncratic responses to climate warming, and their varied implications for species' vulnerability to climate change, a critical task is to understand why some species have not shifted their ranges, particularly at the equatorial or low-elevation limits, and whether such resilience will last as warming continues. Here we show that compensatory changes in demographic rates are buffering southern populations of two North American tundra plants against the negative effects of a warming climate, slowing their northward range shifts, but that this buffering is unlikely to continue indefinitely. Southern populations of both species showed lower survival and recruitment but higher growth of individual plants, possibly owing to longer, warmer growing seasons. Because of these and other compensatory changes, the population growth rates of southern populations are not at present lower than those of northern ones. However, continued warming may yet prove detrimental, as most demographic rates that improved in moderately warmer years declined in the warmest years, with the potential to drive future population declines. Our results emphasize the need for long-term, range-wide measurement of all population processes to detect demographic compensation and to identify nonlinear responses that may lead to sudden range shifts as climatic tipping points are exceeded},

	Abstract = {Consider a patch of favorable habitat surrounded by unfavorable habitat and assume that due to a shifting climate, the patch moves with a fixed speed in a one-dimensional universe. Let the patch be inhabited by a population of individuals that reproduce, disperse, and die. Will the population persist? How does the answer depend on the length of the patch, the speed of movement of the patch, the net population growth rate under constant conditions, and the mobility of the individuals? We will answer these questions in the context of a simple dynamic profile model that incorporates climate shift, population dynamics, and migration. The model takes the form of a growth-diffusion equation. We first consider a special case and derive an explicit condition by glueing phase portraits. Then we establish a strict qualitative dichotomy for a large class of models by way of rigorous PDE methods, in particular the maximum principle. The results show that mobility can both reduce and enhance the ability to track climate change that a narrow range can severely reduce this ability and that population range and total population size can both increase and decrease under a moving climate. It is also shown that range shift may be easier to detect at the expanding front, simply because it is considerably steeper than the retreating back},

	Abstract = {There is increasing concern that multiple drivers of ecological change will interact synergistically to accelerate biodiversity loss. However, the prevalence and magnitude of these interactions remain one of the largest uncertainties in projections of future ecological change. We address this uncertainty by performing a meta-analysis of 112 published factorial experiments that evaluated the impacts of multiple stressors on animal mortality in freshwater, marine and terrestrial communities. We found that, on average, mortalities from the combined action of two stressors were not synergistic and this result was consistent across studies investigating different stressors, study organisms and life-history stages. Furthermore, only one-third of relevant experiments displayed truly synergistic effects, which does not support the prevailing ecological paradigm that synergies are rampant. However, in more than three-quarters of relevant experiments, the outcome of multiple stressor interactions was non-additive (i.e. synergies or antagonisms), suggesting that ecological surprises may be more common than simple additive effects},

	Notes = {() Steve Pacala prompted me to think about for what type of species would fine scale harvesting patterns matter. In particular, he suggested that species that are size structured (substantial ontogenic shift in habitat due to size), and tend to self-assort by size, ought to be more sensitive in numerical dynamics to fishing patterns. I have found a paper, \{Gaylord 2005\}, which looks at how size structure changes the yields that MPAs return to fisheries. In this paper they find that MPAs will increase fisheries yields most for species that experience density dependence after dispersal, and that have sedentary, long-lived adults. Gives some ideas for crucial components to include for ecology: - That all fish species have at least two distinct phases: larval (which includes dispersal) and fish Methods Here they use an integrodifference equation with Gaussian dispersal. They assume symmetric dispersal and that adults dont move from where they are dispersed to. Also assume Beverton-Holt/Ricker density dependence either before or after larvae are dispersed. They add two stages to the model in order to capture the fact that older, larger adults tend to build up inside reserves. This change means that larvae not only compete with each other, but also with already-resident adults. They also assume that older adults have twice the reproductive rate as newly dispersed individuals, trying to mimic the fact that big adults are more fecund. Also assume that older individuals weigh 1.5x that of newly dispersed individuals. Again to account for increased biomass inside reserves. Both adults and juveniles are assumed to have the same natural survival rate, and juveniles move into the adult class at rate gamma. Fishing is implemented either traditionally or with MPA reserves. Traditional fishing is some specified fraction of the individuals are fished out uniformly across all space. With MPAs there is some fraction of land set aside from which no fishing takes place, while fishing occurs without restriction everywhere else. Notes This means that they assume that theres no spatial structure to the fish population except that imposed by MPAs. Results Unsurprisingly, when pre-dispersal density dependence is present for a population that is not size structured, MPAs do worse than than traditional fishing in terms of fisheries yields. This is because the increase in fish density inside reserves reduces larval production. When size-structure is considered the MPAs effectiveness is amplified. Main conclusions MPAs should be extremely helpful for species that have post-dispersal density dependence, and adults whose fecundity increases with size and are sedentary.},

	Abstract = {This paper develops a framework for the study of climate on fish populations based on first principles of physiology, ecology, and available observations. Environmental variables and oceanographic features that are relevant to fish and that are likely to be affected by climate change are reviewed. Working hypotheses are derived from the differences in the expected response of different species groups. A review of published data on Northeast Atlantic fish species representing different biogeographic affinities, habitats, and body size lends support to the hypothesis that global warming results in a shift in abundance and distribution (in patterns of occur-rence with latitude and depth) of fish species. Pelagic species exhibit clear changes in seasonal migration patterns related to climate-induced changes in zooplankton productivity. Lusitanian species have increased in recent decades (sprat, anchovy, and horse mack-erel), especially at the northern limit of their distribution areas, while Boreal species decreased at the southern limit of their distri-bution range (cod and plaice), but increased at the northern limit (cod). Although the underlying mechanisms remain uncertain, available evidence suggests climate-related changes in recruitment success to be the key process, stemming from either higher pro-duction or survival in the pelagic egg or larval stage, or owing to changes in the quality/quantity of nursery habitats.},

	Abstract = {Most climate change predictions omit species interactions and interspecific variation in dispersal. Here, we develop a model of multiple competing species along a warming climatic gradient that includes temperature-dependent competition, differences in niche breadth and interspecific differences in dispersal ability. Competition and dispersal differences decreased diversity and produced so-called 'no-analogue' communities, defined as a novel combination of species that does not currently co-occur. Climate change altered community richness the most when species had narrow niches, when mean community-wide dispersal rates were low and when species differed in dispersal abilities. With high interspecific dispersal variance, the best dispersers tracked climate change, out-competed slower dispersers and caused their extinction. Overall, competition slowed the advance of colonists into newly suitable habitats, creating lags in climate tracking. We predict that climate change will most threaten communities of species that have narrow niches (e.g. tropics), vary in dispersal (most communities) and compete strongly. Current forecasts probably underestimate climate change impacts on biodiversity by neglecting competition and dispersal differences},

	Abstract = {Marine protected areas (MPAs) that exclude fishing have been shown repeatedly to enhance the abundance, size, and diversity of species. These benefits, however, mean little to most marine species, because individual protected areas typically are small. To meet the larger-scale conservation challenges facing ocean ecosystems, several nations are expanding the benefits of individual protected areas by building networks of protected areas. Doing so successfully requires a detailed understanding of the ecological and physical characteristics of ocean ecosystems and the responses of humans to spatial closures. There has been enormous scientific interest in these topics, and frameworks for the design of MPA networks for meeting conservation and fishery management goals are emerging. Persistent in the literature is the perception of an inherent tradeoff between achieving conservation and fishery goals. Through a synthetic analysis across these conservation and bioeconomic studies, we construct guidelines for MPA network design that reduce or eliminate this tradeoff. We present size, spacing, location, and configuration guidelines for designing networks that simultaneously can enhance biological conservation and reduce fishery costs or even increase fishery yields and profits. Indeed, in some settings, a well-designed MPA network is critical to the optimal harvest strategy. When reserves benefit fisheries, the optimal area in reserves is moderately large (mode 30\%). Assessing network design principals is limited currently by the absence of empirical data from large-scale networks. Emerging networks will soon rectify this constraint},

	Abstract = {Humans impact natural systems in a multitude of ways, yet the cumulative effect of multiple stressors on ecological communities remains largely unknown. Here we synthesized 171 studies that manipulated two or more stressors in marine and coastal systems and found that cumulative effects in individual studies were additive (26\%), synergistic (36\%), and antagonistic (38\%). The overall interaction effect across all studies was synergistic, but interaction type varied by response level (community: antagonistic, population: synergistic), trophic level (autotrophs: antagonistic, heterotrophs: synergistic), and specific stressor pair (seven pairs additive, three pairs each synergistic and antagonistic). Addition of a third stressor changed interaction effects significantly in two-thirds of all cases and doubled the number of synergistic interactions. Given that most studies were performed in laboratories where stressor effects can be carefully isolated, these three-stressor results suggest that synergies may be quite common in nature where more than two stressors almost always coexist. While significant gaps exist in multiple stressor research, our results suggest an immediate need to account for stressor interactions in ecological studies and conservation planning},

	Notes = {() The most common models are population dynamics models to predict spread. However there are more powerful statistical tools, notably regression approaches, that could be used more commonly. If the goal is to predict the future rate of spread, prediction from measured rates of spread may be more successful than parameterizing life- history models, especially if the linear spread conjuncture holds. While measured rates of spread can sometimes be seen as implicit predictions of future rates (as long as the regression of square root of area on time is linear), no studies have properly estimated the uncertainty of these predictions. The use of standard statistical tools for forecasting would have the merit of providing confidence intervals for forecasted rates of spread.() There is increasing evidence that evolution can influence the dynamics of invading populations. Repeated introductions, hybridization with native species, novel selective regimes, and the stochastic effects of rapid expansion can change the genetic makeup of introduced populations. In turn, rates and patterns of spread can be shaped by local adaptation, and development of phenotypic plasticity, and/or changes in basic life history characteristics. However we are far from understanding the role of evolution in invasive spread.() Statistical tools like logistic regress and survival analysis can be useful in this application. These tools are a specialized version of generalized linear models in which nonlinear models are transformed to linearity by a link function. These tools are especially useful for dealing with the heterogenous nature of landscapes at within-region scales, especially in modeling the combined influence of abiotic conditions and invasion path- ways.() Independent estimates of dispersal are also required for mechanistic models. For plants, fitting methods have been developed to estimate the shapes of seed dispersal curves from seed traps. Animal tracking, mechanistic modeling of wind or water movement, and genetic approaches have also been employed to measure or estimate dispersal. But for many invading species, the key is measuring human transport systems.() Environmental heterogeneity may influence all stages of the invasion process: dispersal, colonization, and population growth. A handful of empirical studies have measured and compared rates of spatial spread in more than one type of habitat, and these generally find environmentally dependent spread rates. The spatial arrangement of habitat is another aspect of heterogeneity that has attracted interest.() Recent work has emphasized how to move beyond the simplest results of linear rates of spread, yielding very different potential results for the rates of spread in some cases. Inclusion of spatial heterogeneity and other species provide an important challenge. In particular, empirical data do exist to support further development of the theory to include the role of heterogeneity and temporal variability.() But its common to find that empirical estimates in combination with the model do not accurately predict the rates of range expansions in invasions. This is usually explained by invoking rare long-distance dispersal events. This is one of the major challenges to the field: empirical estimation of low probability, long-distance dispersal events.() How to formally integrate spatial heterogeneity into models is a complex problem. The hard part is including heterogeneity in a way that allows relatively general conclusions to be drawn. But there are three approaches:() The appropriate rate of spread of the occupied area also depends on the assumptions about the dynamics of spread. Linear increase can be expressed in a single measurement, with dimensions of km2 year1 if the area is increasing linearly, or km year1 if the radial expansion rate is constant. But if the spread is more complex, the range expansion of an invasive species cannot be described by a single rate. Its difficult to meaningfully compare rates of spread between different species or locations if the underlying dynamics are not specified.() Survival analysis, which uses a GLM with reciprocal link and exponential distribution, is used to predict the probability of surviving for at least time t, given a set of explanatory variables. This is well suited to the question of how long a location will remain free of an invading species.() These integro-difference equation models require parameter estimates for a reproduction function, which may be unstructured or stage structured, and a dispersal kernel.() Most data sets are a series of point counts, and the typical approach is to translate these data into presence/absence records for geographic areas such as counties or cells in a regular grid. Sequential maps of these presence absence data are taken to represent the expansion of invasion. Within a geographic area the total number of species over time is sometimes used as a measure of increasing abundance, and may be standardized for intensity of sampling effort. The kind and quality of data can influence estimates of spread rates.() If the population is studied in one spatial dimension and age structure is ignored, the probability of finding an individual at location x next year is found by summing up the probability over all locations y that an individual is produced at y and then disperses to location x. Typically this model is further simplified by ignoring any spatial heterogeneity and thus k(x, y) = k(| x y |). The dynamics of this model are very similar to the classical model if the dispersal kernel is Guassian, but different dispersal kernels can produce very different dynamic behavior.() Review of theory around species invasions (similar in many ways to what we want to do). Summarizes theoretical and empirical developments in understanding how species spread and invade new habitats.() The linear rate of spread implied in the classical models solution (2f(0)D) does not always hold, as it assumes there is no Allele effect in the per capita growth rate f[p(x,t)]. If the per capita growth rate is negative for small values of the population level, the initial rate of spread can be slower than predicted by the classical solution. Interspecific competition can also lead to nonlinear rates of spread.() The qualitative prediction of the diffusion equation of a linear relationship between the square root of the area and an invasion and time seems to hold true for many invasions, but many spread rates of other invasions seem to increase exponentially with time. In some cases invasions proceed from several foci, which leads to much faster spread than from a single focus. Shigesda et al. (1995) provide a mathematical model for this type of invasion, called stratified diffusion.() Both classical reaction diffusion models and integro-difference equations have shown that established competitors can slow an invading species. A superior resident competitor will prevent invasions, but an inferior resident will slow invasion. In both cases the invasion speed is a decreasing function of the competition strength, with zero invasion sped when the competitors are equal.() Improvements to this approach include incorporating uncertainty and conducting sensitivity analyses. However much of these existing models are quite complex and difficult to relate to the underlying data.() The main use of classical and neoclassical spread models has been to predict the velocity of the invasion front from species attributes related to reproduction and dispersal. There are two types of approaches, those that use independent data to estimate model parameters and those that use the velocity data to fit one or more of the model parameters.() Dispersal as well as recruitment may vary overt ime, although this has been relatively little studied either empirically or theoretically.() The concept of biotic resistance has played an important role in invasion biology, and there is a longstanding expectation that diverse communities should be less invasible. However relatively few studies have examined the rate of spatial spread of invasions as a function of diversity or interactions in the invaded community.() Quantitative predictions from diffusion models parameterized using independent data have rarely predicted velocities that were much higher than observed. Velocities predicted by the linearized models provide an upper bound and so predicted rates that are too high could be because of the linear approximation. But on the other hand, predicted rates of spread were often much lower than observed, suggesting departure from the model.() Mutualisms have also been suggested to affect the spread of invasions, but no studies have explicitly considered the rates of spread. Likewise, many studies have examined the impacts of natural enemies on invasions, very few of these have examined spatial spread.() If new invaders only succeed if their invasion coincides with a nutrient pulse or rainfall event (for example) might explain why predictions of invasions so often fail. However evidence remains scarce on the effects of either episodic or directional variation on invasive spread. Most of the relevant theory concerns temporal variation in reproduction. For populations with discrete reproduction events, population growth is determined by the variance in the growth rates as well as the means: as variance increases, the realized population growth decreases. However, this difference disappears in continuous time models.() Mismatches between data and model predictions highlight one of the more important uses of the spread velocity models, which is in falsifying hypotheses about mechanisms of spread. Testing hypotheses about dispersal mechanisms does not necessarily require independent estimates for both reproduction and dispersal. For example, if the reproduction parameter, we can fit the dispersal parameters from the observed rates of spread and consider whether different dispersal mechanism are consistent with the estimated dispersal kernels. When independent estimates are available, a powerful use of spread models is in confronting alternative dispersal models with the spread data.() Environmentally dependent rates of spread pose a potential limitation on the generality of models, because even for a single species, a model parameterized in one type of habitat may not make accurate predictions elsewhere.() Predators and parasitoids may have the ability to stop, slow or reverse an invasion of the victim species.() The autocorrelated structure of most environmental variation, together with the potential for positive correlation between dispersal and reproduction, should promote high temporal variation in rates of spread of invasive populations. In turn, high temporal variation provides one possible explanation for the time late including Allele effects, adaptation, hybridization, or the delayed arrival of mutualists. But the perceived lag may also be due to a high threshold of detection.() A serious problem in fitting dispersal kernels is that the rate of spread is most sensitive to the behavior of the long distance part of the dispersal kernel, for which the data are least available. Further, fitting the parameters in an assumed functional form for the dispersal kernel is difficult to justify.() The initial (classical) models were phased as partial differential equations that could be used to estimate to predict an asymptotic rate of spread. These are the simplest models and ignores any underlying variation in the environment and age; assumes that reproduction and movement occur randomly during the lifetime of the individual and the movement is essentially the result of a very large number of steps of arbitrarily small size. The model also assume that the highest per capita growth rate occurs when the species is rare. Unfortunately the result (2f(0)D) is not robust to changes in these assumptions. Unfortunately to better match the model to empirical understanding of species, changing these assumptions is just what is required. Thus recent progress in understanding the dynamics of spread has consisted of discovering other simplifying assumptions about the form of the kernel k that are biologically relevant and lead to tractable models.() Gravity: Gravity models assume that movements are not random but are biased by the attractiveness of destinations. Authors using these models have argued that these models may explain why some invasions do not occur as a moving front wave, but as satellite introductions. Gravity models may also be applicable to the spread of human-vectored organisms because site attractiveness is based on human behavior.() Reaction-diffusion: Shigesada and colleagues took a reaction-diffusion approach in which the spread of a single species is examined in an environment with periodic variation in diffusivity and/or growth rate. The most important outcome of this work is that the rate of spread is determined by the geometric mean of the spread rates in different environments. Thus unfavorable habitats can have a dramatic effect in reducing spread rates. One problem with modeling variation in diffusivity is that it is not clear how it should operate; species could move more or less quickly through poor habitat, depending on the organisms ability to identify and to traverse poor habitat.() Logistic regression, which is a GLM with a logic link and binomial distribution, is concerned with the prob- ability of a binary event given a set of explanatory variables. Of particular application to invasions is the probability that a location will become invaded, given eh current or previous distributions of the invader in the landscape and a suite of abiotic variables. By including a dispersal or contact kernel as well as local explanatory variables, logistic regression models can be constructed to mimic the structure of neoclassical and stochastic models already discussed.() Individual-based models: Individual-based models are a popular framework for incorporating detailed information about individual fecundity, dispersal, and landscape structure, but lack the generality of approaches based on the reaction-diffusion framework. Variation in habitat suitability can easily be represented on a digital map, and may lead to unpredictable changes in patterns of individual dispersal. Such simulation approaches are also useful for incorporating corridors and barriers to dispersal. Percolation theory is another approach that examines how spatial heterogeneity affects no only the rate of spread but also its final outcome. So called percolation thresholds, or critical levels of connectivity, determine whether the organism eventually reaches all suitable sites or is limited to a subset of suitable sites by distance or barriers. Percolation theory may be helpful in understanding the relationship between disturbance and the spread of invaders.() Most invasion models do not consider the effects of species interactions on dispersal behavior. But empirical evidence suggests that parasitoids disperse more as the parasitoid to host larvae ratio increases, suggesting an important role for competition.() The general spread model relates the position of reproducing individuals to the position of their parents. This relationship enters into deterministic models as a dispersal kernel (which is the probability that an individual at location y produces an offspring when it is age a which then starts life at location x. Essentially all deterministic spread models start from this basic formulation, and make various simplifying assumptions, as a general model of this form could not be practically solved. So its important to consider the different types of assumptions made and the resulting behavior.() The implicit assumption of continuous time in the classical equation is also important. Changing this assumption has been most extensively studied in the context of discrete-time integro-difference equations.},

@article{Lockwoodetal2002,
	Abstract = {The concept of marine reserves as a method of improving management of fisheries is gaining momentum. While the list of benefits from reserves is frequently promoted, precise formulations of theory to support reserve design are not fully developed. To determine the size of reserves and the distances between reserves an understanding of the requirements for persistence of local populations is required. Unfortunately, conditions for persistence are poorly characterized, as are the larval dispersal patterns on which persistence depends. With the current paucity of information regarding meroplanktonic larval transport processes, understanding the robustness of theoretical results to larval dispersal is of key importance. From this formulation a broad range of dispersal patterns are analyzed. Larval dispersal is represented by a probability distribution that defines the fraction of successful settlers from an arbitrary location, the origin of the distribution, to any other location along the coast. While the effects of specific dispersal patterns have been investigated for invasion processes, critical habitat size and persistence issues have generally been addressed with only one or two dispersal types. To that end, we formulate models based on integrodifference equations that are spatially continuous and temporally discrete. We consider a range of dispersal distributions from leptokurtic to platykurtic. The effect of different dispersal patterns is considered for a single isolated reserve of varying size receiving no external larvae, as well as multiple reserves with varying degrees of connectivity. While different patterns result in quantitative differences in persistence, qualitatively similar effects across all patterns are seen in both single- and multiple reserve models. Persistence in an isolated reserve requires a size that is approximately twice the mean dispersal distance and regardless of the dispersal pattern the population in a patch is not persistent if the reserve size is reduced to just the mean dispersal distance. With an idealized coastline structure consisting of an infinite line of equally spaced reserves separated by regions of coastline in which reproduction is nil, the relative settlement as a function of the fraction of coastline and size of reserve is qualitatively very similar over a broad range of dispersal patterns. The upper limit for the minimum fraction of coastline held in reserve is about 40\%. As the fraction of coastline is reduced, the minimum size of reserve becomes no more than 1.25 times the mean dispersal distance},

Age-structured populations behave as a filter of the environment. This filter is characterised by the species-specific life cycle and life-history traits. An increased mortality of mature individuals alters these characteristics and may therefore induce changes in the variability of populations. The response of a generic age-structured model was analysed to investigate the expected changes in the fluctuations of fish populations in response to decreased adult survival. These expectations were then tested on an extensive dataset. In accordance with theory, the analyses revealed that decreased adult survival and mean age of spawners were linked to an increase in the relative importance of short-term fluctuations. It suggests that intensive exploitation can lead to a change in the variability of fish populations, an issue of central interest from both conservation and management perspectives},

Explanations often emphasize biological distinctions among species, but general mechanisms have been elusive. We tested an alternative hypothesis: that differences in climate velocity-the rate and direction that climate shifts across the landscape-can explain observed species shifts. We compiled a database of coastal surveys around North America from 1968 to 2011, sampling 128 million individuals across 360 marine taxa. Climate velocity explained the magnitude and direction of shifts in latitude and depth much more effectively than did species characteristics.
