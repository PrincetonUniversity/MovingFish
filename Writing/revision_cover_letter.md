Fuller et al. Persistance of populations facing climate velocity and harvest

Dear EcoSphere Editorial Board

We are resubmiting our article (MS#ES14-00533) based on the invitation to re-submit with revisions. We are grateful for this opportunity to re-submit an improved manuscript.

We have made two types of revisions in response to the concerns of the reviewers. Throughout the manuscript, we highlight areas in blue corresponding to new analysis or substantial revision. We highlight these changes here, and provide details about each below.

Ok for EcoApps, also suitable for ICES Marine Science

Reviewer #1 (Comments to Author):

This paper was extremely well written, certainly one of the best drafts I have read in the past few years. The analyses were thorough and their application was well-identified.

However, there is a little too much repetition. For example, we receive the results in the abstract, intro, results and discussion with almost the same language. Thus, consider removing some of this repetition.

The majority of these suggestions are comments for the discussion section:

1. Discussion points could use some more broadening, many of the points made were a recap of the results and their relation to references cited earlier. For example, some commentary on multi species systems might be helpful (see perhaps Travers-Trolet et al. 2014 in PLOS One).
2. More discussion about the relation of findings to invasion studies would also be helpful. While there is some brief info in the discussion, more should be included. For example, Shigesada 1997 includes information and analytical solutions that would he helpful here for the MPA analysis on invasion in heterogeneous habitats that relates to the MPA spacing examined here. Along these lines, also helpful would be more discussion about lessons learned from invasion control, as much of the invasion literature has also focused on the leading edge and would provide some insights here.
3. Additionally, there has been much discussion on MPA spacing from Kaplan (multiple papers), Neubert (chattering paper), and the squeezing from others (starting with Halpern). The impacts of spacing and reallocation can depend on whether the fishery is optimally or over harvested, thus, there needs to be some discussion of this in the paper. Does this matter here when the leading edge is potentially most important? A one sentence acknowledgement that harvesting may be spatially explicit and not uniformly redistributed before or after MPA establishment should also be included as this would have important implications as well. Also, in relation to the paragraph above about invasion control, why would we expect harvesters to harvest the leading edge when the density is lower there? Again, this points out how the reallocation of effort can matter more than the threshold harvesting scenario covers.

Minor comments:

1. There is a disconnect of the analytical methods and the simulation methods, for example, a Laplace dispersal kernel is used for the simulations. A little more discussion about the connection between these two sections and their results would be helpful and should be added to the methods and results sections.
2. Page 17, Line 311 and Page 19, Line 19. These are example sentences where caution should be taken about the words interact and interaction. The authors clearly laid out earlier when impacts could be synergistic, additive, etc... However, the terms interact or interaction might imply something more than additive, so perhaps being clearer when using the words interact or interaction throughout the manuscript would be helpful.

Reviewer #2 (Comments to Author):

Overall comment:
This manuscript presents a novel framework to understand the combined effects of harvesting and climate velocity on population persistence through time. Integrating the integrodifference modelling approach proposed by Zhou and Kot 2011 for climate-induced range shifts, the Authors identified the critical rates of harvesting and climate velocity beyond which populations decline. They found that the effect of both stressors is approximately additive: positive synergies can, indeed, be evidenced only when rates of harvest and climate velocity are close to their critical values. Moreover the Authors investigated the effects on population persistence of both different conservation strategies (Harvest-oriented vs Conservation-oriented protected areas) and different reallocation of the harvesting effort (no reallocation vs full reallocation). They found that, with respect to Conservation-oriented protected areas, Harvest-oriented protected areas decrease population fluctuations at low
climate velocities, if harvesting effort was not reallocated outside the protected area. On the contrary, a reallocation of the effort should involve a reduction of the critical climate velocity and harvesting rate, increasing the extinction risk for the population.


The manuscript is original and quite clearly written. However some clarifications are needed:

- the Authors state their model was built originally for marine species, but it could be applied also to some terrestrial ones (lines 83-85). In my opinion the manuscript could benefit from a clear example (e.g., an application case study): the application of some real parameters (i.e., ‹d›, R0, K, h = proportion of the population harvested) to a well known case study could allow the readers to more easily understand the manuscript. Moreover, the example could facilitate the researchers intending to apply their approach to different biological models or datasets.
- at lines 234 - 239 the Authors explain their simulation scheme. They use 2000 generations to reach equilibrium without perturbations (neither harvesting nor climate velocity). Subsequently, they add harvesting pressure (2000 generations) and, finally, a changing climate. They run the model for 6000 generations and finally, calculate the equilibrium biomass as the mean biomass of 2000 additional generations. If we imagine a univoltine or bivoltine species, the Authors exposed their population to 2000/1000 years of continuous harvesting (with a constant rate?) and, subsequently to 6000/3000 years of changing climate (with a constant velocity?). Did they suppose that the spatial configuration of protected areas remained constant for thousands years?
Also in this case, the absence of an example could not allow the reader to easily understand the manuscript. What does it happen when the Authors shorten these times to simulate the effect of harvesting and climate change on a real biological model? Could I obtain the same results if I expose my species (e.g., a fish with an annual generation time) to 200 or 300 generations of harvesting at a constant rate (after 2000 generations to reach equilibrium with no perturbation) and subsequently to 100 or 200 additional generations of climate change?


Specific comments:
- lines 83 and 417: Which is the difference between plants and trees? What the Authors mean for "plants": only herbaceous ones or the kingdom Plantae? In the latter case, the kingdom includes also trees.
- In the final portion of the Introduction section (lines: 85 - 87 and 93 - 100), the Authors explained their findings. Probably these paragraphs are more suitable for a discussion rather than for an introduction.
- The parameters used for setting the model are specified only in the figure legends (cf. Figure 2 and Figure 3, lines 632 and 651 respectively), probably the insertion in the main text could help the readers.

Literature cited:
- The Authors should use always the same style to write journal titles (italic or not: Literature cited section in the Instruction for Authors (available at http://esapubs.org/esapubs/preparation.htm#Lit) does not provide information about this point).
