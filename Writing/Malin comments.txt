nice, clean title

need to use past tense throughout (found some slips)

order of analytical methods description is odd

results headers should reflect the questions asked

perhaps focus on critical harvest rate, since Zhou & Kot did a lot of the critical speed work

synergistic or additive?? synergistic effect seems miniscule, even over a wide parameter range

how can thresholds universally increase biomass?

"interaction" seems to be used in two ways: synergistic, or as the curved persistence threshold (vs. square in threshold harvest rule)

discussion of synergy is still a bit convoluted and confusing
	additive vs. multiplicative vs. ______. the reader won't understand unless we lay it out (or explain it more simply). 
	
need to comapre to a wider literature than just Mora and Crain. Also, do our results match Mora or not? why or why not?

need to discuss MPA and threshold findings in light of previous work. compare/contrast to other findings

can use all the refs from the intro, for example

should discuss the results in order
	e.g., growth rate effects compared to Perry
	any evidence from nature for synergy? what do people in the literature say, and expect?
	Nye et al. ?

figure legends are too long: explanatory text goes in the Results text

Fig. 3 seems too big (see figure sizes for Ecol App)

Fig. 4: should a larger area be black?

figure generally go at end for submission to a journal
